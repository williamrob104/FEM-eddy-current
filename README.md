# FEM eddy current

This project aims to model eddy current induced in magnetic conductors. The magnetic flux density is the contribution of electromagnet current, eddy current, and material magnetization. Both the finite element method and a modified method is used. The modified method only requires meshing the magnetic conductor, and yields smoother magnetic flux density results. For more information, refer to the [project report](project-report.pdf).
